Link to All of the Code for Week One

http://codepen.io/collection/nLPkgP/

Here is a link to a collection of all of the Code for Week One.  (There may be a few extra files in there as I play with new examples.)  Each individual file is also linked below the lecture videos to help you match the code with the lecture.  I find that it can be annoying to use CodePen for the first few lectures since it causes a lot of pop-up boxes.  Don't worry, we move away from that by Week Two.

Even if you use CodePen, I encourage you to practice writing the code on your own.  For now, I put complete examples in CodePen, but as time goes on I will remove some of the commands to link the code together.  You will need to work on that part on your own..
