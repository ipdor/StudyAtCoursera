# Course Resources

All of the reading material you will need to pass this course is contained within Coursera. Additional resources may be added as optional material, but everything will be online and free.

## Software

The preferred way to code in this class is to use Replit. You can also use an editor such as Notepad++, TextWrangler, Sublime, Visual Studio code, etc. If you do not have the ability to access or install this type of software, [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) has an online code editor - look for the "Try It Out" options. 

## Code

Whenever possible, the code is linked through CodePen, Replit, and a downloadable zip file.  You can choose the format that best suits your learning style.

You can find the code at Responsive Web Design Course Code
.  It is organized by week, so you can check to see if any code is provided for this week's lessons.  Oftentimes you will see two files, a "starter" file and a "complete" file. This way you can start at the same place as me, but still have access to the final product.   If a lesson has a number of files to download, they are combined into a zip file.  Zip files are downloaded automatically to your computer and then you can use free software to open them.

## Lecture Slides

To support learners, accessible lecture slides are provided as downloadable PDF files below, and individually within each lecture video. Please note, sometimes the slides will look slightly different from the videos since I like to update the slides when things change.

# What is Responsive Design?

* It is designing your sites with multiple screen sizes/ resolutions in mind.  
* Sites should "work" under any platform, any browser size, any orientation. The user should have the power.

# Testing Sites

Two ways:  
* Online tools like http://ami.responsivedesign.is  
* Firefox responsive design mode  

# What To Do When Your Tool is Deprecated

* Responsive Design – you want to make sure that your site looks good in multiple viewports

* Automated testing - you want to site that can do that testing with as little work on your part as possible

* Browser extension – you may want a tool that you install on your browser so that you do not need to go to a different tab to test a site.

With this knowledge you can create a search term to match your needs.

* "best automated testers for responsive design"

* "best responsive website testing tools and sites in \<fill-in-the-current-year\>"

* "responsive testing browser extension"
