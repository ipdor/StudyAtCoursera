# Getting Started With Bootstrap

You are not required to use Bootstrap in the coding of your site, but you do want to learn a little about the general framework.  For that you can follow along with the videos.  If you want to really use Bootstrap you can use their online tutorial to get started -   [Get started with Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/).  Bootstrap uses JavaScript!!  So if you do not know JavaScript just know that you need to include links to the Bootstrap js files at the bottom of your HTML files, not the top!!
