# Week 2 Resources

## Review Lecture Videos

If you aren¡¯t familiar with Grid and Flex, review these videos from my other course, Introduction to CSS3.

* Review of Grid(YouTube)https://youtu.be/tC4IF7-RN6Y

* Review of Flex(YouTube)https://youtu.be/2h11fOELFYc

## Code

You can find the code at Responsive Design Course Code
.  It is organized by week, so you can check to see if any code is provided for this week's lessons.

## Lecture Slides

To support learners, accessible lecture slides are provided as downloadable PDF files below, and individually within each lecture video. Please note, sometimes the slides will look slightly different from the videos since I like to update the slides when things change.
