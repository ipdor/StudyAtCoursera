# Setting Up the HTML Document Structure

All HTML documents have a required structure that includes the following declaration and elements: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.



the `<head>` element identifies the top of the document, including any metadata (accompanying information about the page).



```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

> **Self-Closing Elements** 
>
> Not all elements consist of opening and closing tags, such as the previous`<meta>` element.
>
> Other common selfclosing elements include:
>
> - `<br>`
> - `<embed>`
> - `<hr>`
> - `<img>`
> - `<input>`
> - `<link>`
> - `<meta>`
> - `<param>`
> - `<source>`
> - `<wbr>`
