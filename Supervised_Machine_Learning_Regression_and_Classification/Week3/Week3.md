# Classification with logistic regression

## Motivations

When predicting a small handful of possible values instead of any number in a infinite range of numbers, **classification is better** than regression.


**Binary classification** has only two types of categories/classes:  

* Positive/True/Yes/1

* Negative/False/NO/0


Example:  
Is a tumor malignant? Decide malignant or not from a tumor's size.

Solution:  
**logistic regression**(it is a classification algorithm, not regression)



### Quiz
