2. Which of the following are potential benefits of vectorization? Please choose the best option.

It makes your code run faster

It can make your code shorter 

It allows your code to run more easily on parallel compute hardware

**All of the above**

3. True/False? To make gradient descent converge about twice as fast, a technique that almost always works is to double the learning rate alpha. 

True

**False**
