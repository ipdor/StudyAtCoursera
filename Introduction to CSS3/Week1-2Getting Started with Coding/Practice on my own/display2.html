    <div class="row1">Again browsers are always changing.
        HTML5 and future versions are always changing and
        they're trying to add new support.
        The problem is when you see these new
        cool tools they don't always work on every browser.
        So inline, inline block, block and none will work everywhere.
        But here are a few more that are slowly beginning to gain acceptance.
        And those are table, grid and flexbox.
        For grid and flexbox, I'm going to leave it to you to kind of play with it.
        But I did want to show you an example of where a lot of my students find the table
        display really helpful.</div>
    <div class="row1">As you can see, each of the divs is now next to each other because we've told it
        we don't want them to be underneath each other.
        But this really isn't what you were hoping for it to look like.
        So let's go ahead and try adding that float left.
        Save, I'm gonna go ahead over here and refresh. 
        And you can see, it does look a little bit better.
        </div>
    <div class="row1">And you can see, it does look a little bit better.
        So, this is great because we wanted everything to be next to each other.
        But what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna show you something that doesn't work out
        really well.
        And that is this idea of when I resize it.
        Now you can see this idea of that the overflow might be really important because
        now things are going outside the divs themselves.
        Plus, I really don't have any type of margin between them.
        So let's go ahead and add overflow, Hidden,
        or scroll, just to show you what I was talking about there for a second. </div>
        
        <div class="row2">div1</div>
        <div class="row2">div2</div>
        <div class="row2">div3</div>
