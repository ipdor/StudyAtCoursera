# Inference in Code

A new example of Coffee Roasting

The task is given a feature vector x with both temperature and duration, say 200 degrees Celsius for 17 minutes. How can we do inference in a neural network to get it to tell us whether or not this temperature and duration setting will result in good coffee or not?

# Data in TensorFlow

TensorFlow use **matrixes**, instead of vectors.

A tensor here is a data type that the TensorFlow team had created in order to store and carry out computations on matrices efficiently. **Just think of tensor as a matrix.**


use `a1.numpy()` converts a tensor back to numpy array.
