# Speculations on artificial general intelligence (AGI)

## Is there a path to AGI?

ANI has made huge progress in the last decades, so AI is. But that doesn't mean AGI achieved much accomplishment. Even neurons in deep learning are over simplified human neurons, we also know little about how real brain works. Therefore it's really dificult.

However, some experiments shown that human brain is amazingly adaptable. The same area in brain can perform different function by given different data. **Maybe there's one learning algorithm and we can find it.**

# Vectorization (optional)

## How neural networks are implemented efficiently

Vectorized neural networks can be implemented efficiently using matrix multiplications, because computing hardwares, like CPU and GPU, are very good at doing such culculation.

Example:

## Matrix multiplication rules

(Just part of linear algebra.)
